<h1 style="text-align:center;">ICB (Inertia Client Base)</h1>

<h2 style="text-align:center;">A powerful base system for modules, commands, guis and utilities within minecraft.</h2>

## IN BETA

No documentation yet, you technically can use it and start adding features but we do not suggest it yet as there will
more than likely be a lot of changes, and there's no documentation yet.

## Why is there a gui built in but other "Inertia Client" features aren't?

Inertia Client is built on top of ICB, You can use ICB to add any feature you want. Inertia Client its self is not open
source, you cannot view/edit/copy the source code of it.
The Main Gui was going to be a part of Inertia Client and not be open source but we decided to put it in the base system
for anyone to change anything about it/view how it works.

Right Shift to open the Gui, as mention this is the base system, there are no "features" added.
